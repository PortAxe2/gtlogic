                Hi! I graduated in 2021 with a Computer and Communciations
                Engineering degree from AUB. For over a year now, I focused on
                improving my set of full-stack skills and worked on various
                small-scale projects. On this page, Iâ€™ll introduce myself
                more in-depth as well as my interest in joining gtlogic.
