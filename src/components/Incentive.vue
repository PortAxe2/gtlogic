    <p class="incentiveBrief">
        After hearing about gtlogic from a friend, I wanted
        to see if I could be a fit for a position there. Going through
        the website and reading up about their mission and work
        ethics,  I became heavily interested in landing a job at gtlogic.

                    One of the most important things for any employee,
                    especially as a junior, is the opportunity to join
                    a team and an enviornment which help him achieve his
                    full potential. And after reading the website’s ‘people’
                    section,  I found that gtlogic perfectly embodies what I’m
                    looking for in a workplace.The balance of hard work and a
                    fun environment is something I’d love to be a part of!

                <p class="incentiveTxtBrief">
                    For over a year now, I’ve been improving my Full-Stack
                    skills, with an emphasis on Front-End. In my last semester
                    of universitty, I took various courses related to web
                    development and databases. Ever since I graduated, I
                    worked on improving my skills by learning new technologies
                    and frameworks. Recently, I worked with 2 clients to build
                    their requested landing page, as well as doing smaller
                    personal projects to solidify my knowledge.

                    Flexible work hours and having the ability to work
                    from home are a superb bonus. Being able to finish tasks, on time of course,
                    but at your own pace is great.
